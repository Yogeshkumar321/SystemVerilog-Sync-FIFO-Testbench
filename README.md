# SystemVerilog-Sync-FIFO-Testbench
âœ… Project Description: Synchronous FIFO Design and Verification in SystemVerilog This project implements a parameterized Synchronous FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer using SystemVerilog, along with a comprehensive verification environment based on UVM-lite principles. The FIFO design supports configurable depth and width, providing reliable data storage for high-speed systems operating under a single clock domain.  The verification environment includes constrained random stimulus generation, functional coverage, and self-checking scoreboard to ensure robust testing across different scenarios. Key components such as driver, generator, monitor (receiver), scoreboard, and environment are implemented in a modular, reusable manner.
